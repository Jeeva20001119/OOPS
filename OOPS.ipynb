        "**Theory Questions**\n",
        "\n",
        "1.  What is Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)?\n",
        "  - Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm (style of programming) that organizes software design around objects rather than functions and logic.\n",
        "  - Objects represent real-world entities with attributes (data) and methods (behavior).\n",
        "  - These objects are instances of classes, which are blueprints or templates that define what data and behavior an object should have.\n",
        " -  Key Concepts of OOP -Class,Object,Encapsulation,Inheritance,Polymorphism,Abstraction.\n",
        "2. What is a class in OOP?\n",
        "  - A class is a blueprint or template for creating objects (instances).\n",
        "It defines:\n",
        "    - Attributes (data/properties) — what the object has\n",
        "    - Methods (functions/behavior) — what the object does\n",
        "  - A class itself does not hold data for a specific object — it just describes how the object should be structured.\n",
        "3. What is an object in OOP?\n",
        "  - An object is an instance of a class.\n",
        "It’s a real, usable entity created based on a class blueprint.\n",
        " - A class defines what attributes and methods an object should have, and an object is the actual thing you work with in your program.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. What is the difference between abstraction and encapsulation?\n",
        "  - Abstraction:\n",
        "     - Hiding complex implementation details and showing only essential features.\n",
        "     - Focuses on what an object does.\n",
        "     - To reduce complexity and increase efficiency for the user by showing only necessary operations.\n",
        "     - Achieved through abstract classes or interfaces (in some languages like Java, C++). In Python, it’s more conceptual, but can be done using base classes.\n",
        "  - Encapsulation:\n",
        "      - Hiding the internal state of an object and restricting direct access to it.\n",
        "      - Focuses on how the data is protected and controlled.\n",
        "      - To safeguard the object’s data from unintended interference and misuse.\n",
        "      - Achieved using private/protected variables and providing public getter and setter methods.\n",
        "5. What are dunder methods in Python?\n",
        "  - Dunder methods (short for Double UNDERSCORE methods) are special predefined methods in Python that have double underscores __ before and after their names.\n",
        "  - These methods let you define how objects of your class should behave with built-in Python operations like:Printing,Adding objects,Comparing objects,Getting length,Iterating over an object and more.\n",
        "6. Explain the concept of inheritance in OOP?\n",
        "  - Inheritance is a mechanism in OOP where one class (called the child class or subclass) can inherit the attributes and methods of another class (called the parent class or base class).\n",
        "  - This allows you to: Reuse existing code, Extend or modify behavior without changing the original class, Implement a natural “is-a” relationship between classes (e.g. A Dog is an Animal)\n",
        "7. What is polymorphism in OOP?\n",
        "  - In Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), polymorphism means the ability of different classes to respond to the same method name in different ways.\n",
        "  - It allows you to use a common interface while different types of objects behave differently when the same method is called on them.\n",
        "8. How is encapsulation achieved in Python?\n",
        "  - Encapsulation is the practice of restricting direct access to an object's data and allowing it only through methods (getters, setters).\n",
        " - It hides the internal state of an object and protects it from unintended interference.\n",
        " - Public attributes/methods (variable )-\tAccessible from anywhere.\n",
        " - Protected attributes/methods (_variable) -\tIntended for internal use, still accessible but should be treated as private.\n",
        " - Private attributes/methods (__variable) - Name-mangled by Python to prevent direct access.\n",
        "9.  What is a constructor in Python?\n",
        "  - A constructor is a special method that automatically runs when an object is created from a class.\n",
        "  - It’s used to initialize the object’s attributes with default or specific values at the time of creation.\n",
        "  - In Python, the constructor method is always named __init__().\n",
        "10. What are class and static methods in Python?\n",
        " - Both class methods and static methods are special methods in Python classes that are not bound to object instances the same way as regular methods.\n",
        " - Class method: A class method is a method that receives the class itself as the first argument (commonly named cls), instead of the instance (self).\n",
        " - Access and modify class-level attributes.Be called on both the class itself and its instances.\n",
        " - Static method: A static method does not take self or cls as a parameter.\n",
        "  It behaves like a regular function but belongs to the class’s namespace.\n",
        " -Be logically related to the class.Not access or modify class or instance attributes.\n",
        "11. What is method overloading in Python?\n",
        " - Method Overloading is a concept where multiple methods in the same class share the same name but have different parameters (different number or type of arguments).\n",
        " - Python does not support traditional method overloading directly —if you define multiple methods with the same name, the last definition overwrites.\n",
        " - Using default arguments ,Using *args and **kwargs to accept a variable number of arguments Or manually handling different numbers/types of arguments inside a single method.\n",
        "12.  What is method overriding in OOP?\n",
        " - Method Overriding occurs when a child class provides a specific implementation for a method that is already defined in its parent class.\n",
        " - The child class method replaces (overrides) the parent class method when called from a child class object.\n",
        " - This enables runtime polymorphism — where the call to an overridden method is determined at runtime based on the object's class.\n",
        "13. What is a property decorator in Python?\n",
        " - The property decorator in Python is used to turn a class method into a read-only property.\n",
        "  - It allows you to access a method like an attribute, without calling it like a function.\n",
        "  - It’s part of Python’s way of implementing getter, setter, and deleter methods in a clean and Pythonic way, while still providing control over attribute access.\n",
        "14.  Why is polymorphism important in OOP?\n",
        " - Polymorphism is important because it allows different classes to be treated as if they were instances of the same class through a common interface — even though they behave differently.\n",
        " - it's supporting Flexible ,Reusable,Maintainable,Extensible.\n",
        "15. What is an abstract class in Python?\n",
        "  - An abstract class is a class that cannot be instantiated directly.\n",
        "  - It’s designed to serve as a base class for other classes and typically contains one or more abstract methods — methods that are declared but don’t have a complete implementation.\n",
        "  - Abstract classes act as blueprints for subclasses.\n",
        "  - Subclasses must implement the abstract methods defined in the abstract class.\n",
        "16.  What are the advantages of OOP?\n",
        "  - OOP makes your code easier to manage, scale, reuse, and model around real-world scenarios.\n",
        "  -  It supports clean, maintainable, and reliable software development.\n",
        "  - Advantages are: Code Reusability, Modularity, Data Hiding (Encapsulation), Easy to Maintain and Modify, Extensibility and Scalability, Real-World Modeling, Flexibility through Polymorphism, Promotes DRY Principle , Better Collaboration and Teamwork.\n",
        "17. What is the difference between a class variable and an instance variable?\n",
        " - Class Variable:\n",
        "      - A variable that is shared by all instances of a class.\n",
        "      - Directly inside the class body, but outside any methods.\n",
        "      - Can be accessed using ClassName.variable or self.variable.\n",
        "      - One copy exists, shared by all objects of the class.\n",
        "      - When a property should be common for all objects of the class.\n",
        "  - Instance Variable:\n",
        "      - A variable that is unique to each instance (object) of the class.\n",
        "      - Inside the constructor (__init__ method) using self.\n",
        "      - Accessed using self.variable (specific to the object).\n",
        "      - Each object has its own copy, with independent values.\n",
        "      - When each object needs to store different data for the same attribute.\n",
        "18. What is multiple inheritance in Python?\n",
        " - Multiple inheritance is a feature in which a child class can inherit from more than one parent class. This means a single class can have the properties and methods of multiple classes.\n",
        " - Python fully supports multiple inheritance, unlike some languages like Java (which avoid it due to ambiguity problems like the diamond problem — which Python handles using the Method Resolution Order (MRO)).\n",
        "19. Explain the purpose of ‘’__str__’ and ‘__repr__’ ‘ methods in Python?\n",
        "  - str() - For End-User (Readable Output)\n",
        "      - Defines the \"informal\" or \"user-friendly\" string representation of an object.\n",
        "      - Called by functions like print() or str().\n",
        "      - Meant for displaying information to end users.\n",
        "  - repr() - (Debugging/Official Representation)\n",
        "       - Defines the \"official\" or \"developer-friendly\" string representation of an object.\n",
        "       - Called by the repr() function, or by the interpreter when you type an object name in a Python shell.\n",
        "       - Meant to be unambiguous and ideally should be valid Python code to recreate the object.\n",
        "20. What is the significance of the ‘super()’ function in Python?\n",
        "  - The super() function is used to call a method from the parent (or superclass) inside a child (subclass).\n",
        "  - It allows you to access and invoke the methods of a superclass from a subclass without explicitly naming the parent class.\n",
        "  - Most commonly used to: Invoke the parent class’s constructor (__init__()),\n",
        "   Call parent class methods that have been overridden in the child class.\n",
        "21.  What is the significance of the __del__ method in Python?\n",
        "  - The __del__() method is a special (dunder) method in Python called a destructor.\n",
        "  - It is automatically invoked when an object is about to be destroyed.\n",
        "  - It allows you to define cleanup actions that need to be taken when an object is no longer needed — like: Closing open files or network connections,Releasing memory or resources, Logging object deletion events.\n",
        "22. What is the difference between @staticmethod and @classmethod in Python?\n",
        " - @static method:\n",
        "     - Does not receive self or cls as its first argument.\n",
        "     - Cannot access or modify class or instance attributes.\n",
        "     - Behaves like a regular function placed inside a class for organizational purposes.\n",
        "     - Called using either the class name or an instance.\n",
        "  - @class method:\n",
        "     - Receives cls as its first argument (not self).\n",
        "     - Can access or modify class variables.\n",
        "     - Is called using either the class name or an instance.\n",
        "     - Typically used for factory methods (methods that create instances in a specific way) or for modifying class-level data.\n",
        "23. How does polymorphism work in Python with inheritance?\n",
        " - In Python, polymorphism with inheritance means that:\n",
        " - A child class can override methods of its parent class.\n",
        " - You can write code that works on objects of different classes through a common interface (parent class methods).\n",
        " - At runtime, the method call is resolved based on the actual object's type — not the reference type.\n",
        " - This is called runtime polymorphism (or dynamic method dispatch).\n",
        "24. What is method chaining in Python OOP?\n",
        "  - Method chaining is a technique in which multiple methods are called sequentially on the same object in a single line of code.\n",
        "  - Each method returns the object itself (usually using return self), so the next method can be called on the same instance.\n",
        "  - It improves: Code readability, Conciseness, Clean fluent interfaces.\n",
        "25. What is the purpose of the __call__ method in Python?\n",
        " - The __call__() method allows an instance of a class to be called like a function.\n",
        " - When you use the syntax object() — Python will internally call object.__call__() if it’s defined.\n",
        " - You can make an object behave like a function.\n",
        " - It allows you to encapsulate behavior inside an object while still using function-call syntax.\n",
